Brief Introduction:
Be Productive is a app that monitors your productivity through various features that could be developed into a habit.
Be Productive allows the user to create a to do list or a checklist, it also can be used as a time table to keep yourself on track.
The app also can keep track of our behaviors and habits when doing task over the long run thus generating a analytic graph to show how productive the user is. 
With these, the app aims to increase productivity of the users and help them in a meaningful way.
